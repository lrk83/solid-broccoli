## Description

This is a website designed for avid readers to search for books, and a compile a list of books to read.

When you load the site you are presented with an input field to search for books, and a menu with the option to signup/login. Without logging in you are able to search for books - the search menu loads options though Google Books. In order to save those books for later, you need to login. Clicking the login/signup option in the menu opens a modal with inputs for logging in or siging up. Once you are logged in you are returned to the search menu, and this time when you search for books the results include a button to save the book to your account. You can view your saved books, and remove them from your book list by clicking on "See Your Books" in the menu.
